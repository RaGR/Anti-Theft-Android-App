# Anti-Theft-Android-App
Offline-first Android Anti-Theft MVP — non-root, free, on-device protection against shutdown or theft. Detects power-menu/shutdown hints, authenticates owner (voice → biometric → PIN), captures camera + GPS evidence, encrypts locally, and escalates via SMS or optional call (IR 110). 100 % offline, Kotlin + Jetpack Compose.
